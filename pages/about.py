st.write("What is Diabetic Retinopathy?")
st.write("Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a progressive eye condition caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye). Due to prolonged high blood sugar levels. It is one of the leading causes of vision loss and blindness among working-age adults globally. DR affects individuals with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, and its progression can be silent in early stages, making regular screening and early detection crucial.")

st.write("What Causes it?")
st.write("The main cause of diabetic retinopathy is chronic hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar), which weakens and damages the retinal capillaries over time. As the damage progresses, blood vessels may: Leak fluid or blood

Become blocked

Stimulate abnormal vessel growth (neovascularisation), leading to scarring or retinal detachment")
